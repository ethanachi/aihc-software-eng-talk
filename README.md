# aihc-software-eng-talk

This repository accompanies the following talk:

[Software Engineering Practices in Python](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JkqHqQTqKGgcWB0wvjt7jDgPxpitxbtyO0NR9n62WMA/edit?usp=sharing). Invited presentation, Stanford ML Group (2020).

The code here is intended as an example of good style vs. bad style as applied to typical machine learning boilerplate code (`main.py`). It contains an entire homebrew machine learning library (`ml.py`), as well as various stages of refactoring (`main_clean_stagek.py`). The final version has been decomposed into various modules.

The following concepts are covered:

- tuple unpacking
- `zip`
- `*args, **kwargs`
- list comprehensions, conditional list comprehensions
- modularity
- objects
